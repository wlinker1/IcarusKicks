Shoes for the Overconfident

### Concept

The Greek myth of Icarus is a cautionary tale to all that hubris will always end in ruin. But we at **Icarus Kicks** are firm believers that overconfidence will always work out. Just as Icarus constructed his wings from ordinary wax and feathers, we wanted to design our shoes with simplicity and functionality in mind. Yes, Icarus does plummet to his death when his wings melt, but you can bet he'd hit the ground in a pair of **Icarus Kicks**.
