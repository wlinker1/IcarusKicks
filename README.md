### Concept

The Greek myth of Icarus is a cautionary tale to all that hubris will always end in ruin. But we at **Icarus Kicks** are firm believers that overconfidence will always work out. Just as Icarus constructed his wings from ordinary wax and feathers to achieve flight, we wanted to design our shoes with simplicity and functionality in mind. Yes, Icarus does plummet to his death when his wings melt, but you can bet he'd hit the ground in style wearing a pair of **Icarus Kicks**.

### Design

With any pair of our footwear, you're guaranteed function. Our debut "Bladers" model intends to keep both you and your feet safe from any obstacle that you could face, guaranteed†. Equipped with a 5" dagger, bullhorn, and cushioned soles, you'll be prepared for anything life throws at you.†

### Challenges

When developing the Bladers, we faced an issue with a bad ground rail, causing the knife and speaker to become erratic.While that took hours to pin down and debug, Mike from TCL/NSA gave an immense amount of time and help to get the shoes back on track.

###### † Icarus Kicks cannot guarantee absolute safety, wear at own risk.
